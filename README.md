# odin-recipes
This is the readme for my first project on TOP.
The goal of the project is to make me comfortable working with html by building a basic recipes website.

Throughout the project i implemented my knoledge of html to build a website for consulting recipes. I leveraged my familiarity with cli commands to speed up the development and structuring the project with minimal project, along with my knwolegdge of git to efficiently keep track of changes made to the code throughout the project.
